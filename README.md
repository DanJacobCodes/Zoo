# Epicodus Zoo

### By Dan Jacob 6/9/17

Epicodus JavaScript Project Week 3 || Angular 2

## Planning
1. Configuration/dependencies
* Node.js/npm
* Angular 2
* bootstrap

2. Specs
  * As a user I want to log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.
  * As a user I want to view a list of animals I have logged.
  * As a user I want options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (more than 2 years of age).
  * As a user I want to click an animal to edit its name, age or caretakers.


## Description
This application serves as practice with the Angular 2 Framework. The application is intended for zoos as an animal tracking tool. Users (which in this case are the zoo staff) will be able to add animals to the webpage complete with key details pertaining to the animal. In addition, users will be able to edit animal information, and also sort animals by age.

## Future Goals
  * Add ability to search Animals
  * Add ability to save to a Database
  * Let users create a profile with login
  * Upload pictures of the animals
